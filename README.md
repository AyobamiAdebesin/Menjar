## General info
We are solving the problem of people having access to local dishes from different cultures. This app will help users place orders or book reservations for local dishes. It will allow users to have access to dishes from other cultures and denominations.

It is not a recipe app for discovering how to make a particular dish.

It would help people have access to a platform where they can order local meals without the stress of going around to get them.

People from various cultures use the site, as do tourists visiting a new location and trying to sample local cuisine.

It is dependent on a specific locale. We built the app for the sole purpose of ordering local Nigerian foods.
